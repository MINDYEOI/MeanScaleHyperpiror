I wrote this with reference to the following two codes. 
1. https://github.com/liujiaheng/compression 
2. https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI

## Dataset
I used Flicker2W, DIV2K and CLIC2020's for training.
1. Flicker2W dataset can be found on liujiaheng's repository
2. 'Train data (HR images)' in [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/)
3. 'Training Dataset P' & 'Training Dataset M' [CLIC2020](http://challenge.compression.cc/tasks/)
