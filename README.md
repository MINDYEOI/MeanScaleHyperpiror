### Mean-Scale Hyperprior Image Compression Model (without Context model) 

This repository is my implementation of training and evaluation code for the model above. (original paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02736)
I wrote this with reference to the following two codes. 
1. https://github.com/liujiaheng/compression
