## Mean-Scale Hyperprior Image Compression Model (w/o Context model) 
<br>

## Introduction

**This repository is the implementation of training and evaluation code for the model above.**

(original paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02736)
<br>

I wrote this with reference to the following two codes. 
- https://github.com/liujiaheng/compression 
- https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI
<br>

## Dataset
I used Flicker2W, DIV2K and CLIC2020's for training.
- Flicker2W dataset can be found on liujiaheng's repository
- 'Train data (HR images)' in [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/)
- 'Training Dataset P' & 'Training Dataset M' [CLIC2020](http://challenge.compression.cc/tasks/)
